   How do you switch among them? using bars
   How to connect ViewStack with bars?
   Should answer very detail
2. If I have a datagrid and load two elements from an array collection with two fields. If I want to change the 
   stuff in the field and I just changed the Array collection side, even it is [Bindable], does the value of the 
   attribute change? How can I change that? You have to design a event inside a function, and handle this event to change the value.
3. Event Flow, three phases, be able to explain very clearly.

1. Tell me about the collection framework.
2. Tell me about the multi-threading in java.
3. Suppose you have a lot files, each file has its ID. Now you have a record file to record the read and return process. 
   The record file has two rows, named in and out. “In” mean the number of files have been read, “out” means the number 
   of files have been returner. Consider codes below:
	class Processor{
		counter c;
		inProcess(){
			setIn(c.getIn()+1)
			persist();
		}

		outProcess(){
			setout(c.getOut()+1);
			persist();
		}

		persist(){
			truncate(0);	//clear the record file
			flush(file);  	//write back to the record file
		}
	}

	class counter{
		int in, out;
		//setter and getter below
	}

   The processor is working in the multi thread environment, how do you think of the code, is there any problem? How to solve it?

4. Let say there are two ways to apply the loan, called A, B. Different type of loan has different process.
   Consider codes below:
	Loan processLoan(Object o){
		if(o is from web-services){	//It doesn’t matter where o comes from, it just define volume = o.getVolume();	//different type of loan
			duration = o.getDuration();
		}
		else if(o is from htp){
			volume = o.getVolume() + 1;
			duration = o.getDuration() + 1;
		}else{
			“I don’t know”; 
		}	
	}
   Now, I want to make a standard process for both A and B, how to do it?

Interviewer #1 (Mr. Lawrence Zeng):
1. Introduction
2. Questions about the last project
    Try to explain to manager about your project without using any technologies.
    POJO class of your last project which you may be familiar with.
3. Algorithm
    Write a method in Java to implement checking Palindrome Strings. (I checked null pointer, empty string, forgot about empty spaces)
4. Exception Handling
    Checked vs Unchecked
    How to create your own RuntimeException?
 
Interviewer #2:
1. Introduction
2. Questions about the last project
    How to handle cross-browser issues. (I told him we checked the version of browser, if not supported, let the user upgrade the browser. 
    He said there should be a matrix tracking statistics of users' browser.)
    Your responsibility of last project.
3. Algorithm
    Get an element which is not duplicated in an array. For example, [3, 4, 5, 3, 4] ==> 5. (I used Hashtable<key, count>, but maybe not the best solution)
 
Interviewer #3:
1. Introduction
2. Questions about the last project.
    How many people in your team? What's your responsibility.
    Hardest problem in the last project?
    Have you talked to the users or just the team manager?
    Try to draw an architecture diagram of your last project. (I explained to him MVC pattern)
3. Algorithm
    Also something about Palindrome String. (I gave a solution, he said using recursion may be better)
4. Factory Design Pattern, difference from new ClassName()?
5. Does Java support multiple inheritance? Why?
6. Inheritance vs Composition
 
Interviewer #4:
1. Dead lock & solution
2. HashMap vs Binary Search Tree
    In which scenario, HashMap has O(n) instead of O(1) so that BST's O(logN) is the better choice?
    (I told him if not comparing the key but the values, HashMap has O(n). He said another thing is if you want to check key > 5, BST is better.)
3. Singleton
    This question he mentioned a tricky way to do singleton in C++. static Singleton instance = new Singleton();
